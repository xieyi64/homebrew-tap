# RocketMQ Homebrew Tap

This tap is for products in the RocketMQ.

## How do I install these formulae?

Install the tap via:

    brew tap xieyi64/tap

Then you can install individual products via:

    brew install rocketmq

The following products are supported:

* RocketMQ `brew install xieyi64/tap/rocketmq`

## Default Paths for the RocketMQ Formula

In addition to installing the RocketMQ server and tool binaries, the `rocketmq` formula creates:

 * a configuration dir: `/usr/local/etc/rocketmq`
 * a log directory path: `/usr/local/var/log/rocketmq`
 * a data directory dir: `/usr/local/var/rocketmq`

## Starting the RocketMQ Server

### Run `RocketMQ` as a service

#### service setup 

To have `launchd` start `rocketmq` immediately and also restart at login, use:

```
$ brew services start rocketmq
```
If you manage `rocketmq` as a service it will use the default paths listed above. To stop the server instance use:

```
$ brew services stop rocketmq
```

#### manual setup 

before setup rocketmq server, run nameserver firstly:

```
$mqnamesrv
```

and then setup broker:

```
mqbroker -n localhost:9876 -c  /usr/local/etc/rocketmq/broker.conf
```

then, we could use mqadmin to send messages or view cluster&topics info.create topic as below. more commands see mqadmin help:

```
mqadmin updateTopic -t  topicTest  -n 127.0.0.1:9876  -c DefaultCluster  -r 2 -w 2
```

finally, we should shutdown rocketmq server: nameserver and broker.

```
mqshutdown namesrv
mqshutdown broker
```
